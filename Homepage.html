				What is League of Legends?
			</p>
			<p>
				League of Legends is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game (short MOBA) that was published by Riot Games in 2009.</br>
				Since League of Legends was first released, the game grew very big.</br>
			</p>
			<p>	<img class="leftimg" src="Bilder/Home/Arena.jpg"/>
				Today it is the biggest MOBA on the market and is also the most played game worldwide with over 100 million players.</br>
				The game itself is free to play to everyone but there are ingame purchases you can buy with real money.</br>
				These purchases are only cosmetic, because Riot Games wants to keep their game competetive. They include skins, emotes and icons. </br>
				Riot has made over 2 billion USD in 2017 only. Their game has over 80 million active players.</br>
				League of Legends averages 100.000 people watching live on twitch.tv all the time.

				Gameplay
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In League of Legends every match is a 5v5 and is seperate from the other matches but to keep the game fresh Riot releases new Champions every so often. There are currently 141 Champions, each with unique abilities and play styles.</br>
				Riot Games also patches their game every week, trying to balance the game and make the gameplay not repetetive.</br> 
				Here are the Champions:</br>

			<p> <img class="rightimg" src="Bilder/Home/Summoners Rift.jpg"/>
				At the start of a game players choose their Champions and prepare for battle.</br>
				The goal of each match is to destroy the enemy Nexus, a structue which is at the middle of the enemy teams base. It is protected by variuous deffensive sctructues.</br>
				So to win a game you have to play in team with your 4 team members.</br>
			</p>
			<p>
				The Playground in League is a map that is called Summoners Rift.</br>
				Players are assigned different lanes, such as top lane, jungle, mid lane and bot lane. In which they can play different roles, like tank, carry or support.</br>
				You get stronger, the longer the game goes on: You level from 1-18, buy items from the shop and kill objectives that give you an advantage, like dragons or the baron.</br>
			</p>
			<p></p><p></p>
			<p>
				Riot Games doesn't just work on the game all the time. Sometimes they also create little cinematics from the game to make the players more exited on the new content they are getting.
