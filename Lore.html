				Many centuries ago Runeterra was plagued by a great war, called The Runewars. It completely destroyed the whole continent and left it devastated.
				To prevent further destruction the Institution of war made a pact with all kingdoms that ordinary wars are forbidden and conflicts need to be solved in a 5 vs 5 Match,
				by representative Champions, in a magical world called Summoners Rift. People can't die in this world and no Land can be damaged. Now all Domains represent their interests
				and believes in this gamelike system.
